        "1": "You support a Node.js application running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in production. The application makes several HTTP requests to dependent applications. You want to anticipate which dependent applications might cause performance issues. What should you do?",
        "2": "You created a Stackdriver chart for CPU utilization in a dashboard within your workspace project. You want to share the chart with your Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team only. You want to ensure you follow the principle of least privilege. What should you do?",
        "3": "Your organization wants to implement Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) culture and principles. Recently, a service that you support had a limited outage. A manager on another team asks you to provide a formal explanation of what happened so they can action remediations. What should you do?",
        "4": "You have a set of applications running on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, and you are using Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring. You are bringing a new containerized application required by your company into production. This application is written by a third party and cannot be modified or reconfigured. The application writes its log information to /var/log/app_messages.log, and you want to send these log entries to Stackdriver Logging. What should you do?",
        "5": "You are running an application in a virtual machine (VM) using a custom Debian image. The image has the Stackdriver Logging agent installed. The VM has the cloud-platform scope. The application is logging information via syslog. You want to use Stackdriver Logging in the Google Cloud Platform Console to visualize the logs. You notice that syslog is not showing up in the \"All logs\" dropdown list of the Logs Viewer. What is the first thing you should do?",
        "6": "You use a multiple step Cloud Build pipeline to build and deploy your application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). You want to integrate with a third-party monitoring platform by performing a HTTP POST of the build information to a webhook. You want to minimize the development effort. What should you do?",
        "7": "You use Spinnaker to deploy your application and have created a canary deployment stage in the pipeline. Your application has an in-memory cache that loads objects at start time. You want to automate the comparison of the canary version against the production version. How should you configure the canary analysis?",
        "8": "You support a high-traffic web application and want to ensure that the home page loads in a timely manner. As a first step, you decide to implement a Service Level Indicator (SLI) to represent home page request latency with an acceptable page load time set to 100 ms. What is the Google-recommended way of calculating this SLI?",
        "9": "You deploy a new release of an internal application during a weekend maintenance window when there is minimal user tragic. After the window ends, you learn that one of the new features isn't working as expected in the production environment. After an extended outage, you roll back the new release and deploy a fix. You want to modify your release process to reduce the mean time to recovery so you can avoid extended outages in the future. What should you do? (Choose two.)",
        "10": "You have a pool of application servers running on Compute Engine. You need to provide a secure solution that requires the least amount of configuration and allows developers to easily access application logs for troubleshooting. How would you implement the solution on GCP?",
        "11": "You support the backend of a mobile phone game that runs on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. The application is serving HTTP requests from users. You need to implement a solution that will reduce the network cost. What should you do?",
        "12": "You encountered a major service outage that affected all users of the service for multiple hours. After several hours of incident management, the service returned to normal, and user access was restored. You need to provide an incident summary to relevant stakeholders following the Site Reliability Engineering recommended practices. What should you do first?",
        "13": "You are performing a semi-annual capacity planning exercise for your flagship service. You expect a service user growth rate of 10% month-over-month over the next six months. Your service is fully containerized and runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Standard regional cluster on three zones with cluster autoscaler enabled. You currently consume about 30% of your total deployed CPU capacity, and you require resilience against the failure of a zone. You want to ensure that your users experience minimal negative impact as a result of this growth or as a result of zone failure, while avoiding unnecessary costs. How should you prepare to handle the predicted growth?",
        "14": "Your application images are built and pushed to Google Container Registry (GCR). You want to build an automated pipeline that deploys the application when the image is updated while minimizing the development effort. What should you do?",
        "15": "Your product is currently deployed in three Google Cloud Platform (GCP) zones with your users divided between the zones. You can fail over from one zone to another, but it causes a 10-minute service disruption for the affected users. You typically experience a database failure once per quarter and can detect it within five minutes. You are cataloging the reliability risks of a new real-time chat feature for your product. You catalog the following information for each risk:\n* Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) in minutes\n* Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) in minutes\n* Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) in days\n* User Impact Percentage\nThe chat feature requires a new database system that takes twice as long to successfully fail over between zones. You want to account for the risk of the new database failing in one zone. What would be the values for the risk of database failover with the new system?",
        "16": "You are managing the production deployment to a set of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. You want to make sure only images which are successfully built by your trusted CI/CD pipeline are deployed to production. What should you do?",
        "17": "You support an e-commerce application that runs on a large Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster deployed on-premises and on Google Cloud Platform. The application consists of microservices that run in containers. You want to identify containers that are using the most CPU and memory. What should you do?",
        "18": "Your company experiences bugs, outages, and slowness in its production systems. Developers use the production environment for new feature development and bug fixes. Configuration and experiments are done in the production environment, causing outages for users. Testers use the production environment for load testing, which often slows the production systems. You need to redesign the environment to reduce the number of bugs and outages in production and to enable testers to toad test new features. What should you do?",
        "19": "You support an application running on App Engine. The application is used globally and accessed from various device types. You want to know the number of connections. You are using Stackdriver Monitoring for App Engine. What metric should you use?",
        "20": "You support an application deployed on Compute Engine. The application connects to a Cloud SQL instance to store and retrieve data. After an update to the application, users report errors showing database timeout messages. The number of concurrent active users remained stable. You need to find the most probable cause of the database timeout. What should you do?"
