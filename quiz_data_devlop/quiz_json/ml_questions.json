What is the correct way to write the predict request?",
        "23": "Your organization's call center has asked you to develop a model that analyzes customer sentiments in each call. The call center receives over one million calls daily, and data is stored in Cloud Storage.

You have trained an object detection neural network and deployed the model version to AI Platform Prediction for evaluation. Before deployment, you created an evaluation job and attached it to the AI Platform Prediction model version. You notice that the precision is lower than your business requirements allow. How should you adjust the model's final layer softmax threshold to increase precision?",
        "26": "You are responsible for building a unified analytics environment across a variety of on-premises data marts. Your company is experiencing data quality and security challenges when integrating data across the servers, caused by the use of a wide range of disconnected tools and temporary solutions.
