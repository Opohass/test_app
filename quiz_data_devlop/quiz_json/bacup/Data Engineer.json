Based on these patents, they can create many reliable, high-speed backbone links with inexpensive hardware.\n\nCompany Background -\nFounded by experienced telecom executives, MJTelco uses technologies originally developed to overcome communications challenges in space. Fundamental to their operation, they need to create a distributed data infrastructure that drives real-time analysis and incorporates machine learning to continuously optimize their topologies. Because their hardware is inexpensive, they plan to overdeploy the network allowing them to account for the impact of dynamic regional politics on location availability and cost.\nTheir management and operations teams are situated all around the globe creating many-to-many relationship between data consumers and provides in their system. After careful consideration, they decided public cloud is the perfect environment to support their needs.\n\nSolution Concept -\nMJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:\n\u2711 Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.\n\u2711 Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.\nMJTelco will also use three separate operating environments `\" development/test, staging, and production `\" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.\n\nBusiness Requirements -\n\u2711 Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.\n\u2711 Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.\n\u2711 Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers\n\u2711 Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.\n\nTechnical Requirements -\n\u2711 Ensure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data\n\u2711 Rapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.\n\u2711 Allow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day\n\u2711 Support rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.\n\nCEO Statement -\nOur business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.\n\nCTO Statement -\nOur public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.\n\nCFO Statement -\nThe project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure.

Existing Technical Environment - Flowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center: \u2711 Databases - 8 physical servers in 2 clusters - SQL Server `\" user data, inventory, static data - 3 physical servers - Cassandra `\" metadata, tracking messages 10 Kafka servers `\" tracking message aggregation and batch insert \u2711 Application servers `\" customer front end, middleware for order/customs - 60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers - Tomcat `\" Java services - Nginx `\" static content - Batch servers \u2711 Storage appliances - iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts - Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) `\" SQL server storage Network-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups \u2711 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers - Core Data Lake - Data analysis workloads \u2711 20 miscellaneous servers - Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts, Business Requirements - \u2711 Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled panty of production. \u2711 Aggregate data in a centralized Data Lake for analysis \u2711 Use historical data to perform predictive analytics on future shipments \u2711 Accurately track every shipment worldwide using proprietary technology \u2711 Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources \u2711 Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud \u2711 Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are met Technical Requirements - \u2711 Handle both streaming and batch data \u2711 Migrate existing Hadoop workloads \u2711 Ensure architecture is scalable and elastic to meet the changing demands of the company. \u2711 Use managed services whenever possible \u2711 Encrypt data flight and at rest Connect a VPN between the production data center and cloud environment SEO Statement - We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around. We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping. CTO Statement - IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology. CFO Statement - Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment. Flowlogistic's management has determined that the current Apache Kafka servers cannot handle the data volume for their real-time inventory tracking system. You need to build a new system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that will feed the proprietary tracking software. The system must be able to ingest data from a variety of global sources, process and query in real-time, and store the data reliably. Which combination of GCP products should you choose?",
